# Dancer Transition Resource Centre - 2014 Annual Report
I created this interactive Annual Report as my final project for HackerYou's Part-Time HTML/CSS course.  Designed in HTML5 / CSS3 / jQuery and meant to be an interactive alternative to the printed report.

Played around with navigation menu overlay, css columns, css animations, flexbox, HTML5 video and media queries.  Added interactivity with jQuery.  I also delved into some Sass mixins and functions.  I'm looking forward to building on these skills and forever learning to write semantic, clean, efficient code!
